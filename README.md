# About

**Why?** As a hiker, I want to plan, edit, and share tracks on interactive and immersive maps.

**What?** A desktop application with a 2D map for topographic analysis and a 3D map for terrain analysis.

**How?** The idea is to make a complete solution based on:

* The powerful route planning software: [QMapShack](https://github.com/Maproom/qmapshack/wiki),
* The immersive 3D map browser: [VTS frontend](https://github.com/melowntech/vts-browser-cpp),
* The best maps with global coverage through the [Melown](https://www.melowntech.com/) and [ExploreWilder](https://explorewilder.com/) proxies.

# Work in Progress

This project is experimental.

# Build for GNU/Linux Desktop

Clone the Git repository with all submodules and compile.

```
git clone -b 3D --recursive https://github.com/ExloreWilder/qmapshack
mkdir build_QMapShack
cd build_QMapShack
ccmake ../qmapshack
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/include/gdal
make --jobs=`nproc`
```

And run the application.

```
./bin/qmapshack
```
